**What are Recommender Systems**

Recommendation systems describe the techniques used to predict
ratings and opinions in which a user might have a propensity to express.

A recommender system is a technology that is deployed in the
environment where items (products, movies, events, articles) are to be
recommended to users (customers, visitors, app users, readers) or the
opposite.
